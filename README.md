# React-Redux Boilerplate

React-Redux Boilerplate is a project template that provides an easier and faster way to start a React+Redux project with TypeScript. It comes with various features, including React, Redux, TypeScript, Webpack, Jest, Tailwind, EsLint, and Prettier.

## Features
### React
A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to rendering views.

### Redux
A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It provides a centralized store for managing application state and makes it easy to reason about state changes.

### Redux-Toolkit
An opinionated, batteries-included package for efficient Redux development. It includes utilities for simplified Redux store setup, creating reducers and actions, and handling immutable updates.

### TypeScript
A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to the language. It helps catch errors earlier in the development process and improves code readability and maintainability.

### Webpack
A module bundler that allows developers to bundle and optimize their code for production. It supports a wide range of asset types, including JavaScript, CSS, and images, and provides powerful features for code splitting and lazy loading.

### Jest
A popular testing framework for JavaScript applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests and supports a wide range of features, including mocking, code coverage, and snapshot testing.

### Tailwind
A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles for common UI elements. It allows developers to quickly build responsive and consistent user interfaces without writing custom CSS.

### EsLint
A popular linter for JavaScript that helps identify and fix syntax errors, coding style issues, and other common programming errors. It provides a wide range of customizable rules and integrates with many popular text editors and build tools.

### Prettier
An opinionated code formatter that helps ensure code consistency and readability across teams. It supports a wide range of languages and integrates with many popular text editors and build tools.

### Esri-Loader 
A lightweight library for loading the ArcGIS API for JavaScript asynchronously. It helps improve application performance by loading only the required modules when needed.

## Getting Started
Before you start, make sure you have a fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point.

1. Fork this repository and clone your own fork to your computer: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-redux-boilerplate.git
    ```


2. From the project's root directory, install the required packages (dependencies):

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. To run and test the app on your local machine (http://localhost:8080):

    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

    This will start a server instance and begin listening for connections from localhost on port `8080`.

4. To build/deploye the app, you can run:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

    This will place all files needed for deployment into the `/dist` directory.
